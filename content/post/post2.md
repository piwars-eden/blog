### Theme
Before applying we got to thinking about how our robot would fit in the theme. 

> The theme for 2020 is Disaster Zone! It is all to do with natural and man-made disasters with a special nod to our favourite disaster movies.

We cycled through the standard nuclear disaster, zombie apocalypse and similar ideas. It then (because we love music) got us thinking about songs that reference disasters and we arrived at 'Nothing but Flowers' by Talking Heads. Here's a sample of their lyrics:

From the age of the dinosaurs  
Cars have run on gasoline  
Where, where have they gone?  
Now, it's nothing but flowers

So it's the end of the world, a huge disaster has occured and now nature has taken over!

### Prep
We met in a pub and got our Trello board doing. The initial questions we had were:

* What do we need to buy to have an MVP
* What's our budget
* Who is doing what

After an initial bit of research we decided to go for Pi2Go Mk2 because we really don't have a clue what we're doing and it seemed a good starter set with enough for us to have an itital robot.
