With busy schedules we've found having time to code together a bit tricky but today was the day to make a lot of progress. 

Today we: 
* (retrospectively) added to the git repo (my bad..) 
* worked out how to connect a controller and map commands
* investigated some designs for a shell for the robot (we're thinking of 3D printing it)
