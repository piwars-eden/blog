We both love to code, solve puzzles but we've missed working together on a challenge. Piwars gives us a chance to learn new skills, and enhance others, while having something tangible to aim for. 

Thoughts from Talia:

> I particularly want to improve some programming skills that I don't get to work on in my day job. I like the physical aspect of tweaking the robot as it gives a bit of change to sitting at a keyboard and coding.

Thoughts from Alex:

> I first heard about PiWars at Pycon2019 where past particpants were full of passion and enthusiasm for the event. I've been in data analytics for a while and want to explore other areas of tech - this competition gives me an opportunity to explore whilst challenging myself.
